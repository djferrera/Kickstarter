Columbia Data Analytics Boot Camp: First Homework Assignment

Three Kickstarter conclusions based on provided data:
1.	Kickstarter campaign categories where you are most likely to experience success: Film & Video, Music, and Theater (NOTE: Film & Video is exclusive to the US. Music and Theater are both US and International).  Food, Journalism and Publishing tend to be failures.
2.	Further breaking down the most successful categories into their sub-categories provides further insight. For Film & Video; Documentaries, Shorts and Television more often succeed, as opposed to Animation and Drama. Almost all Music subcategories are successful – with the exceptions of Faith, Jazz and World. Rock music seems to be a guaranteed winner. Plays are the proven winners for theater, but also have a high failure rate that should not be ignored.
3.	Campaign launch dates are overall less conclusive when speculating on success potential. There is some variation by category, but good advice would be to avoid launching in August and December. April, which skews high on success rate and low on failure rate, may be the best bet.

Limitations of dataset:
1.	The majority of the data provided is for US campaigns. Foreign countries could be grouped to provide a general ‘International’ dataset, but with the exception of maybe Great Britain it wasn’t possible to come to any conclusions about specific foreign countries.
2.	I did not find the ‘Live’ breakdown especially helpful, as the campaign’s success / failure has yet to be determined.
3.	Not provided data, but I am curious to know who started these campaigns. Even in very general terms: professional, amateur or student.
